# Portfolio
 This is my portfolio website! It's built with html, css and React and designed and developed by me. There is a blog section that uses BLogger's REST api. This site is intended for employers to tell them a little about myself and showcase work and knowledge as well as provide as much contact as necessary.
 
 ### Demo

### General Use
Contact page uses formspree. The phone number is a google number that will transfer calls directly to my cellphone. I was hesitant to put my actual phone number because I didn't want it to be swiped by bots and have my cell number spammed/polluted.

Because the page uses a lot of 100vh, there were challenges making it responsive. In other words, shrinking the width isn't what it's going to look like on a phone. In order to see how it's viewed on a phone, chrome dev tools or just accessing the address from a cellphone is the only way. Please don't just narrow the width, without making the right adjustments to the height. The amount of preview posts that is shown, is determined when the page loads. If adjustments are made later, then the blog section won't update unless the page is refreshed. 

### Future plans
The only future plans I have would be to learn PHP so I don't have to use formspree as a middleman.   I also want to parse more images from the blog. Right now my parsing regex only takes the first image. 

### Tech
```
html, css, javascript/react, RESTapi
