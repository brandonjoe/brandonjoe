# Portfolio
 This is my portfolio website! It's built with html, css and React and designed and developed by me. This site is intended for employers to tell them a little about myself and showcase work and knowledge as well as provide as much contact as necessary.
 
### General Use
Contact page uses formspree. The phone number is a google number that will transfer calls directly to my cellphone. I was hesitant to put my actual phone number because I didn't want it to be swiped by bots and have my cell number spammed/polluted.

Because the page uses a lot of 100vh, there were challenges making it responsive. In other words, shrinking the width isn't what it's going to look like on a phone. In order to see how it's viewed on a phone, chrome dev tools or just accessing the address from a cellphone is the only way. 

### Future plans
The only future plans I have would be to learn PHP so I don't have to use formspree as a middleman. If I continue to add more projects, I would need to expand the "portfolio" section because I can't possibly fit all my projects if each section is limited to 100vh.
